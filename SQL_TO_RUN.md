# SQL & Ops to run (Ambria rebuild)

Collected commands to run in the **Supabase SQL Editor** (and CLI) — batched so you can
run them in one sitting. Items are ordered; safe to re-run (idempotent).

> Status legend: ⬜ = pending you to run · ✅ = confirmed already run

---

## 1. Base schema (migration 001) — ✅ already run
`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` (25 tables). Confirmed live (inventory,
users, vendors, etc. all responding).

## 2. Admin seed (tarun) — ✅ already run
```sql
insert into public.users (id, name, username, password, role, active)
values ('u_admin','Tarun','tarun','ambria@admin','Admin',true)
on conflict (id) do update set name=excluded.name, username=excluded.username,
  password=excluded.password, role=excluded.role, active=excluded.active;
```

## 3. LMS contract cache (migration 002) — ✅ done (verified: table live + contracts synced)
Enables instant Calendar loads (server-side LMS sync → table).
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lms_contracts (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept TEXT,
  entry_no TEXT,
  guest_name TEXT,
  data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  synced_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_lms_contracts_synced ON lms_contracts (synced_at);
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE lms_contracts;
```

---

## Edge Functions (CLI)
- `lms` — ✅ deployed (verified live)
- `season` — ✅ deployed + `SEASON_EXPORT_KEY` set (verified live)
- `anthropic` — ⬜ NOT deployed. Needed for ALL AI features: Inventory photo-scan, Production
  finished-vs-reference photo comparison, and **Events → AI Scan** (Claude Vision deck → decor
  element extraction → inventory auto-match). These paths fail gracefully until it's deployed:
```bash
supabase functions deploy anthropic
supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

> Note: Events also renders PPT/PDF decks to slides client-side via pdf.js (loaded from CDN at
> runtime, like the reference) — no install or SQL needed. No new tables for Phase 10/11; the
> `event_orders`, `truss_allocations`, `production_requests`, `blocks` tables are all in
> migration 001. Truss override/simulation/audit + the blocks document live as JSON blobs in
> the existing `settings` table (faithful to the reference's Redis-blob model).

## Per-user app access (migration 003) — ⬜ optional
Adds a `users.apps text[]` column so a user can be granted Studio, IMS, or both. The
in-app header switcher + route gating work WITHOUT this (access is derived from role:
Admin → both, Sales → studio, ops → ims). Run only when you want explicit per-user control:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS apps text[] DEFAULT NULL;
-- grant a specific user both apps:
UPDATE public.users SET apps = ARRAY['studio','ims'] WHERE username = 'tarun';
```

## Studio Rate Card seed — ⬜ (no SQL — just open the app once)
`rate_card` is empty in the DB. Open **Studio → Manage → Pricing** once; the app
auto-seeds the 60 rate items, which also populates IMS → Admin → Sub-Categories and
Flowers → Recipes.

---

## Library → row-per-photo table migration — ⬜ RUN AFTER restoring the 29-Jun backup
The Studio library moved off the `ambria-library-v2` settings blob (whole-array saves caused mass
data loss) to the row-per-photo `library` table. The table + realtime already exist (migration 001);
this only adds a `data` JSONB catch-all for fields without typed columns (_verified, _aiTagged,
lightCount, unrecognized, etc.). Run this ONCE in the SQL editor, then tell Claude to run the backfill.
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.library ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS data JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;
```
Then: (1) Claude backfills `library` rows from the restored blob, (2) Claude merges the branch to
deploy the app, (3) redeploy the tagger: `supabase functions deploy batch-tagger`.
